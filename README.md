This repository is a majors dissertation project for Aberystwyth University. The aim of this project is educational.

## Current status
* Simulation tool: Stable âœ…
* Analysis tool: In development

## How it works: ##

There is a list of pre-made networks :
 - Tiny (10 nodes)
 - Small (25 nodes)
 - Medium (50 nodes)
 - Big (500 nodes)

All the defualt networks have nodes well-connected. However, you can create a new Lightning Network and choose a different network topology by selecting:
- Number of Nodes
- Number of channels per node

When a network is loaded. You can start the simulation by clicking Edit>Start and random nodes start to generate transactions along the network.

## How to get started: ##

* Get the source code 
* You can use the main folder as an Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA workspace.
* Build the maven projects
* Run the GUI suite **com.carlos.lnsim.lnsim.GUI**
* If you do not get the simulation up and running please create an issue ticket.
